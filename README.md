# bench
A cross-platform benchmarking tool coded in Rust. It is lightweight, fast, and efficient.

## Features
- Tells how long (in milliseconds) a program takes to complete
- Allows arguments to be used in the program being benched
- Allows you to interact with the program *while* it's running
- Tells exit code

## Example
`bench mcservman -c New`

(Runs `mcservman` with the args `-c` and `New`, and will allow the user to interact with the program while it runs)
